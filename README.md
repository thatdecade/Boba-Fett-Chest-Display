# Boba-Fett-Chest-Display
This is the software and hardware design for the display on Boba Fettâ€™s chest plate.  It was developed in collaboration with Joshua Kane.

The animation script is laid out in an easy to understand format.  Each segment of the display is fully programmable in the animation.
Just 12 lines of code to processes the animation and update the display!
